##########  Module 1  ##########
######### Case Studies #########
############ 2/7/2020  #########

# Why Look at Case Studies? #
# Classci networks 
# LeNet - 5

# AlexNet
# Similar model but much bigger 
# ReLLu 
# Training multiple GPUs

# VGG 
# 16 layers

# ResNet 

# Inception 

 
# Classic Networks # 


# Residual Networks #
# "short cut"/ skip connection 

# Why ResNetwork ? # 
# It skip some steps, but the feature extracting is not hurt 


# Networks in Networks and 1 X 1Convolution # 
# Shrink the number of convolution 

# 2/8/2020 # 
# The problem of computational cost 
# Bottleneck layer 

# Inception Module #

##########  Module 2  ##########
## Practical Advices for Using ConvNets #

# Use Open-Source Implementation #
# GitHub 

# Transfer Learning #

# Data Augumentation #
# Mirroring method 

# Color shifting 

# Implement distortions during training 

# State of Computer Vision #
# Two sources of knowledge
# - laabeled data 
# - Hand engoineered features 

# Tips on doing well on Benchmark/Winning competitions
# Ensembling
# - Train severalnetworks independently 
# - Multiple-crop at test time
# - Use open source code 
# - Use pertained models
